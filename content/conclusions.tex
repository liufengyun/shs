\section{Conclusion}

In this paper I have proposed a criteria for a good definition of the concept free will. With this criteria in mind, I put forward a new definition of free will and studied the problem of determinism and responsibility from this new perspective.

Test add \cite{sep-moral-responsibility} and \cite{sep-freewill}.

I leave the problem for further research on how the new conception of free will is possible in a determined or undetermined world. My intuition is that the new conception will fundamentally change the way how we approach the problem.
