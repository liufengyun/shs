\section{Conclusion}

In this paper I showed that all previous discussions about free will are based on \emph{the myth of choice}, which views free will as the capacity to choose. I showed that this view is flawed and should be abandoned.

Instead of thinking free will as the capacity to choose, I propose we should think it as the capacity to generate choices. Based on this view, free will is creative, varies in degrees and can be improved.

If I were successful in the two tasks above, then it would cast light on the puzzle of free will and reshape future debates about free will.

However, I don't claim that all problems about free will are solved, as people may ask \emph{what's the essence of human creativity}. Nevertheless, \emph{creativity} is a concept much less mysterious than the \emph{magic capability to choose}, as we are acquainted with animals and intelligent programs which are able to exhibit creativity. What I tried to do and hopefully managed to doing is to demystify free will.
