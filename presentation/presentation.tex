\section{Traditional View of Free Will} % (fold)
\label{sec:Background}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will as the Capacity to Choose}
  Traditional philosophers characterize free will as the \alert{capacity to choose}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Libertarians: \emph{The ability to do otherwise}
  \item Compatibilists: \emph{The ability to align desires and actions}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{The Magic Power of Choice}
  An agent has free will can do either A or B, solely based on his/her choice.

    \emph{Two Roads Diverged In a Yellow Wood}
  \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{The Magic Power of Choice}
  Once owned this magic power, it can be used \alert{anywhere}, \alert{anytime} and on \alert{any matters}.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Two Tasks of Presentation}
  I dub the view which regards \emph{free will as the magic power of choice} as the \alert{myth of choice}.\\[1cm]

  Tasks of this presentation:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Break the \emph{myth of choice}
  \item Show that \emph{free will is creative}
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Free Will Is Not Irrationality}
  Rationality means you should choose the better one!

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/rationality.jpg}\\
    \emph{Only an insane deliberately makes a suboptimal choice!}
  \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Rationality Is Not A Mysterious Capacity}

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
    def decide(opt1, opt2) = {
      if (opt1 betterThan opt2)
          choose(opt1)
      else if (opt2 betterThan opt1)
          choose(opt2)
      else
          ...
    }
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will Is Not Hesitation}
  If A and B are seemingly equally good, then you're in trouble!

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/ass.jpg}\\
    \emph{Buridan's ass}
  \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will Is Not Hesitation}
  Two seemingly equally good choices may not be equal in fact, it's only that you are unable to differentiate them.\\[0.5cm]

  Hesitation is usually a reflection of \alert{inability} to decide efficiently, where you need help from experts -- more experienced and informed people in the field, or you need more training in the field.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Hesitation Is Not A Mysterious Capacity}

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
    def decide(opt1, opt2) = {
      if (opt1 betterThan opt2)
          choose(opt1)
      else if (opt2 betterThan opt1)
          choose(opt2)
      else
          decide(opt2, opt1)
    }
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will Is Not Randomness}
  If you resort to randomness, you are giving up free will!

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/dice.jpg}\\
  \end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will Is Not Randomness}
  Resorting to randomness to try luck implies you are aware that the two choices are very likely to be unequal, but unable to differentiate them.\\[0.3cm]

  Failure to differentiate the better choice and resorting to randomness \alert{unnecessarily} is a reflection of \alert{inability}.\\[0.3cm]

  Resorting to randomness doesn't mean some real random process in the world, it only means you let yourself to be determined by external forces that you can't predict.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Randomness Is Not A Mysterious Capacity}

  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
  def decide(opt1, opt2) = {
    if (opt1 betterThan opt2)
       choose(opt1)
    else if (opt2 betterThan opt1)
       choose(opt2)
    else
       choose(random(opt1, opt2))
  }
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will Is Not the Capacity to Decide}

  The \alert{myth of choice} bankrupts:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The capacity to decide can't differ from the program
  \item There's nothing special about the capacity to decide
  \item The capacity to decide can't honor the name \emph{free will}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Free Will is Creative} % (fold)
\label{sec:creative}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will is Creative}

  If we exclude the \alert{capacity to decide} from free will, the only thing left that can honor free will is \alert{the capacity to generate choices}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will is Creative}

  More creative one is, better choices can be generated and decided, thus more free one is.

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will Varies in Degrees}

  Creativity varies in degrees, thus free will \alert{varies in degrees}.\\[0.5cm]

  One's free will improves if one's creativity improves.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Free Will is Thematic}

  Creativity is thematic, thus free will is also \alert{thematic}.\\[0.5cm]

  The correct grammar for talking about free will is: \alert{X exhibits free will on topic T}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Creativity Honors Free Will}

  Human beings can still be proud of their free will, as they are much more creative on a lot of more topics than animals.
